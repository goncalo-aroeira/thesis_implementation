1. Introduction
Overview of gene embeddings in computational biology.
Importance of transformer models like scGPT in learning biologically meaningful representations.
Objective: Extract pretrained gene embeddings for downstream analysis.
2. Methodology
2.1 Model and Pretrained Weights
Description of scGPT as a transformer-based foundation model.
Loading pretrained weights (best_model.pt) and configuration files (args.json, vocab.json).
2.2 Gene Tokenization
How genes are converted to tokens using vocab.json.
Handling missing genes (e.g., using <pad> token).
2.3 Extracting Gene Embeddings
Using GeneEncoder to generate 512-dimensional embeddings.
Code used for model inference and embedding extraction.
2.4 Saving and Formatting the Embeddings
Storing embeddings as a structured dataset (gene_embeddings.csv).
Data format: genes as rows, embedding dimensions as columns.
3. Validation and Analysis
3.1 Dimensionality Check
Ensuring embeddings have correct shape (num_genes, 512).
3.2 Gene Similarity Analysis
Computing cosine similarity between biologically related genes (e.g., TP53 vs. MDM2).
3.3 Visualization of Embeddings
Using UMAP to visualize gene clusters.
Expected clustering behavior based on scGPTâ€™s pretraining.
4. Results
Summary of generated embeddings.
Examples of similar genes based on embedding distance.
Initial insights from visualization (if applicable).
5. Discussion
How these embeddings compare to other methods.
Potential downstream applications (e.g., gene clustering, regulatory network inference, perturbation prediction).
Limitations and possible improvements.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
Summary of embedding extraction.
Next steps, such as fine-tuning scGPT or integrating these embeddings with single-cell datasets.
