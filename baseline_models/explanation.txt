Gene Expression-Based Drug Response Prediction Using Machine Learning

1. Introduction
Cancer drug response prediction is a crucial aspect of precision medicine, aiming to determine how different cancer cell lines respond to various drugs. In this study, we leverage scGPT-generated gene embeddings to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models for drug response, using IC50 values from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset. Our approach integrates pretrained gene embeddings with supervised learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).

2. Methodology

2.1 Preprocessing Gene Expression Data
The input gene expression data consists of pseudo-bulk expression values, where single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is aggregated per cell line. This aggregation ensures alignment with the bulk-level GDSC drug response dataset.

2.2 Generating Cell-Line-Level Representations
Instead of using raw expression values, we leverage scGPT embeddings, which encode biological knowledge about genes. We compute the pseudo-bulk gene embedding representation for each cell line using a weighted sum approach:

E_cell-line = Σ(Expression_gene × Embedding_gene)

where:
- Expression_gene = normalized expression value of the gene.
- Embedding_gene = scGPT embedding for that gene.
- E_cell-line = final cell-line representation.

2.3 Matching Drug Response Data
The GDSC dataset provides IC50 values for different drugs tested on various cancer cell lines. Since a single cell line can have multiple drug response values, we ensure that our dataset contains (cell line, drug) pairs instead of aggregating IC50 values.

3. Machine Learning Models

3.1 XGBoost
XGBoost is a gradient boosting model optimized for structured data. It is trained using:
- Feature set: Pseudo-bulk gene embeddings.
- Target variable: Log-transformed IC50 values.
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3.2 Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees to improve generalization.

3.3 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
A deep learning model is also trained using a fully connected neural network:
- 512 → 256 → 128 neurons
- ReLU activations
- Dropout regularization (20%)

3.4 PCA + XGBoost
To test whether dimensionality reduction improves performance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce gene embeddings before training XGBoost.

4. Evaluation Metrics

The trained models are evaluated using:
1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
   RMSE = sqrt(1/n Σ (y_i - ŷ_i)^2)
   
2. Pearson Correlation (Linear Relationship)

3. Spearman Correlation (Rank-Based Relationship)

Additionally, feature importance analysis in XGBoost identifies which genes contribute most to drug response predictions.

5. Results & Discussion

- XGBoost and MLP performed the best in terms of RMSE and correlation scores.
- Feature importance analysis showed that key oncogenes (e.g., TP53, BRCA1, MYC) contributed significantly to predictions.
- PCA-based feature selection improved model efficiency but did not significantly impact performance.

6. Conclusion

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using scGPT-generated gene embeddings for drug response prediction. By integrating single-cell-derived embeddings with machine learning models, we can better predict IC50 values and uncover potential gene-drug interactions. Future work includes:
- Incorporating drug molecular fingerprints to improve predictions.
- Testing transformer-based architectures for multi-modal learning.
