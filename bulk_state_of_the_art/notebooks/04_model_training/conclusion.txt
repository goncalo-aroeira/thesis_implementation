📈 Insights from Boxplots (Simple Models)
- All models have similar RMSE distributions, with Elastic Net performing slightly better overall.
- Dummy regressor shows consistently negative R² scores, as expected.
- Ridge and ElasticNet provide modest positive R², showing that even simple linear models can capture some variance in the drug sensitivity signal.
- ElasticNet has the highest median and mean R², suggesting a slight but consistent improvement in predictive capability over Ridge.

✅ Conclusion (Simple Models)
- Elastic Net emerges as the best performer among simple models, outperforming Ridge in both RMSE and R².
- Despite the simplicity, Ridge and ElasticNet outperform the Dummy model, validating the signal present in the gene expression features.
- These models establish a reliable baseline for comparison against more complex architectures.


## 🌲💥 Complex Model Comparison

### Models Evaluated:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### Performance Summary:

| Model        | RMSE (Mean ± Std) | RMSE (Median) | R² (Mean ± Std) | R² (Median) |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| RandomForest | 1.31 ± 0.40       | 1.26           | 0.039 ± 0.130    | 0.037        |
| XGBoost      | 1.35 ± 0.41       | 1.30           | -0.021 ± 0.131   | -0.030       |

📈 Insights from Boxplots (Complex Models)
- Random Forest consistently outperforms XGBoost in both RMSE and R² across most drugs.
- XGBoost displays a slightly wider spread and consistently negative R², indicating worse generalization.
- Random Forest achieves positive R² on average, suggesting it is able to extract more meaningful signal from the PCA features.

✅ Conclusion (Complex Models)
- Random Forest is the superior complex model in this context.
- XGBoost may not generalize well to this specific task, possibly due to overfitting or sensitivity to feature distribution in PCA space.
- Random Forest is more stable and robust, making it a strong candidate for final model selection or ensembling.



## 🏆 Final Comparison: Elastic Net vs Random Forest

### Performance Summary:

| Model        | RMSE (Mean ± Std) | RMSE (Median) | R² (Mean ± Std) | R² (Median) |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Elastic Net  | 1.32 ± 0.41       | 1.27           | 0.028 ± 0.074    | 0.025        |
| Random Forest| 1.31 ± 0.40       | 1.26           | 0.039 ± 0.130    | 0.037        |

📈 Visual Summary (Elastic Net vs Random Forest)
- Both models display nearly identical RMSE distributions, with Random Forest slightly better on average.
- Random Forest clearly outperforms Elastic Net in R², with higher median and larger positive spread.
- Elastic Net performs consistently, while RF has higher variance but better upper-tail performance.

✅ Final Conclusion
- Both models offer strong baselines for drug sensitivity prediction using PCA-compressed gene expression.
- Elastic Net provides simplicity, interpretability, and stable performance — ideal for use cases needing fast or explainable models.
- Random Forest delivers better overall performance, especially in terms of variance explained (R²), and is recommended as the best-performing model.
- These results justify using Random Forest for future experiments, or as a reference in comparisons with deep learning or transfer learning models.
